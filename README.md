# welcome to dinner calculator
This may be used as a template for when you go out with a bunch of friends and need to calculate how much everyone owes you for the hefty bill.

use case: ate at a korean restaurant with 13 people. Some people split dishes, some people ordered their own. Everyone pitches in to pay for birthday boy's food. Complex on paper, right? I'd rather press keys on my keyboard rather than my calculator.
